# Exchange-Rate-Prediction
This project dealt with predicting the actual values of weekly average exchange rates for the USD/TRL currency pair, using the weekly averages of various fundamental macro-economic variables. Support vector regression models with a variety of kernels were utilised in the process, and hyper-parameter tuning was performed on the best kernel. This kind of work has important applications in forex trading. 

The macro-economic variables used were:

-	Inflation rate differential between USA and Turkey 
-	Interest rate differential between USA and Turkey
-	The differential of the GDP growth rate between USA and Turkey
-	The unemployment level differential between USA and Turkey
-	Turkeyâ€™s external debt
-	Turkey current account balance
